Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability is that the attacker can get access to the cookie's session id by having user to click on
some link, and use the saved cookie to access users' accounts.

The secure version makes the cookie's session information specific to its site, so that when user go to other
sites, the cookies are not there, therefore not accessible to attackers.

It violates the integrity property.

Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The vulnerability is that the attacker can access all the data without authorization by inserting database
query in the url.

By sanitizing the http request, it can prevent inserting database query to url.

It violates the confidentiality property.

We can also use encryption in transit or storage so that even if the data is accessed, it cannot be understood.
